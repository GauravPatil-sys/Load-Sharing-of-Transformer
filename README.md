# Load-Sharing-of-Transformer
Traditional power distribution systems suffer from imbalanced load distribution, inefficiency, and a lack of real- time fault detection, which can lead to grid instability and equipment damage. The "Automatic Load Sharing Transformer with Cutoff System" was developed to address these issues. It combines load-sharing technology and a proactive cutoff mechanism to optimize load distribution, enhance reliability, and improve safety in power grids. This innovation reflects the evolution of power distribution technology in response to increasing demandsfor efficiency, sustainability, and grid modernization. This report will explore the system's components, workingprinciples, benefits, and applications in more detail.
